## Introduction

Welcome to the LeetCode Java Solutions repository! Here, you'll find Java implementations for over 450 LeetCode problems, organized by topics such as "Arrays and Hashing." Whether you're a beginner looking for examples or an experienced developer seeking efficient solutions, this repository is designed to assist you in your coding journey.

## Folder Structure

The solutions are organized into folders based on topics and difficulty levels. The structure is as follows:

- `Arrays_and_Hashing/`
  - `Easy/`: Easy-level problems
  - `Medium/`: Medium-level problems
  - `Hard/`: Hard-level problems
- `Linked_Lists/`
  - `Easy/`: Easy-level problems
  - `Medium/`: Medium-level problems
  - `Hard/`: Hard-level problems
- ... (add more folders based on topics)

## Naming Convention

Each Java file is named according to the following convention:

`[ProblemNumber]_[ShortProblemDescription].java`

For example:

- `001_Two_Sum.java`
- `102_Level_Order_Traversal.java`

## Comments and Documentation

Comments have been added to explain the thought process, algorithms used, and any important considerations. For further details on specific solutions or common coding patterns, refer to the [Wiki](wiki).

## Testing

Test cases have been provided with each solution to validate the correctness of the code. Feel free to explore and adapt the test cases to your requirements.
